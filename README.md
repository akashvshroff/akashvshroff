## Hey there, my name is Akash Vikram Shroff.

Programming for me is a form of expression, much like English. It is about choosing the right tools for the job and crafting a clear, concise solution much like succinctly communicating an idea. It is about coming up with an efficient way to tackle a hurdle that others can understand easily. Programming ultimately, is about problem solving. I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics to hone that very ability - problem solving. To help me tackle challenges that lie at the intersection of CS+Math and develop solutions at the cutting edge of the fields. 

I dabble in Python, app dev (through Flutter) and love trying to solve puzzles using code (or more accurately love struggling trying to solve puzzles). 

If you want to reach out to me to chat about anything tech related or rave about how good the show Silicon Valley is, you can use my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-vikram-shroff) or shoot me a [mail](mailto:akushroff@gmail.com).
