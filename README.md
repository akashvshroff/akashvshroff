## Hey there, my name is Akash Vikram Shroff.

I am a self-taught programmer, specialising in Python and I absolutely love solving puzzles and developing algorithms in order to make things work as smoothly and efficiently as possible! I also dabble in a bit of full-stack development with Django, JS, HTML and CSS as well and consistently look to upgrade my skills and the technologies that I am proficient in.

For more information about myself and to reach out to me, you can use my LinkedIn [here](http://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-vikram-shroff).
