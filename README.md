## Hey there, my name is Akash Vikram Shroff.

My first 'Hello World.' made me feel invincible. I thought all of programming was just that; one or two lines of code that magically conjured up giants like Google and Amazon. Over time, I've come to realize that programming is not magic, but it can accomplish magical things. For me, programming is a form of expression, akin to language. It's about selecting the right tools and crafting clear, concise solutions that efficiently tackle challenges. I studied Mathematics & CS at Northwestern University, and I'm currently honing my problem-solving skills to push the boundaries of AI and ML. I strive to develop solutions at the cutting edge of these fields, tackling the most exciting challenges at the intersection of CS+Math.
