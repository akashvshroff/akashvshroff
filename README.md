## Hey there, my name is Akash Vikram Shroff.

![alt-text](https://github.com/akashvshroff/akashvshroff/blob/master/LinkedIn%20(2).png)

I am a self-taught programmer, specialising in Python and I love developing algorithms to solve puzzles and make things work as smoothly and efficiently as possible - I'm afraid that my need to automate everything might one day lead to a robot uprising.

I am currently learning app development with Flutter, and have some experience full-stack development with Django, JS, HTML and CSS and love building trinkets with my Raspberry Pi.

If you want to reach out to me to chat about anything tech related, you can use my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-vikram-shroff) or shoot me a [mail](mailto:akushroff@gmail.com).
