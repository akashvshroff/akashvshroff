## Hey there, my name is Akash Vikram Shroff.

My first 'Hello World.' made me feel invincible. I thought all of programming was just that; one or two lines of code that magically conjured up giants like Google and Amazon. Over time, I've come to realize that programming is not magic, but it can accomplish magical things. For me, programming is a form of expression, akin to language. It's about selecting the right tools and crafting clear, concise solutions that efficiently tackle challenges.Currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Northwestern University, I'm honing my problem-solving skills to push the boundaries of AI and ML. I strive to develop solutions at the cutting edge of these fields, tackling the most exciting challenges at the intersection of CS+Math.

I dabble in Python, SQL, ML projects and love trying to solve puzzles using code (or more accurately, love struggling trying to solve puzzles). 

If you want to reach out to me to chat about anything tech related or rave about how good the show Silicon Valley is, you can use my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-vikram-shroff) or shoot me a [mail](mailto:akashvshroff@gmail.com).
